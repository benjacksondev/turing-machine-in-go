# turing-machine-in-go

I have decided to build a Turing Machine in Go to complement my leaning in *CETM70 - Computer Science Principles And Practice* class at SU (Sunderland University).
The goal is to internalise some of the concepts surrounding Alan Turing's Turing Machine. 

## Run TM

To run the project, with go installed, simply run `go run .` from the project root.
